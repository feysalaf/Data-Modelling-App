# Data Modelling Interface

This is a user interface built to represent any kind of data coming from the server. The interface connects to the server through an API. The idea is to generalize 
the interface enough to be able to add just a config file where the connections can be made to the servers API, but we aren't there yet ;).

* Indicator nuggets alert the user of connection or the lack of it by shifting colors upon a change of state.

* A clean interface designed to display maximum amount of information smartly
* Integrated LaTeX module allows to write maths right on the page and it's rendered dynamically in realtime
* An animated logo, because why not


## What I learned 

* Data architecture and abstraction in Angular framework

* Integration of other open source libraries into your project 

* Properly structuring the code(even html) to allow scalability

* Using mathematical functions in javascript to create interesting animations

* The importance of generality and how crucial to writing reusable code which is less prone to errors

* Importance of using types in the code

* Dedication, focus and sheer will
